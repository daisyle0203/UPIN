# Re:View

## Description

- The motivation behind creating this webpage was to help address the everyday concerns and problems of todays interviewing process, by implementing an app that allows users to post a review about an interview they had with a company for other users to see and comment on.
- The purpose of this particular project displays our knowledge of class topics covered through the last six months of our course, as our group members worked in a collaborative environment to use the tools and practices learned to create this final product.
- Throughout the process of working on this project, we all learned how to operate on Github within project repository, including creating & merging branches, navigating through pull requests, issues, and merge conflicts, and most importantly getting hands on experience working with other classmates, which helps all involved learn how to communicate and work collectively to accomplish a number of tasks.
